## Detection Engine

**Intelligence Layer**: Analyzes requests to understand intent, complexity, scope, and optimal execution strategy.

### Pre-Operation Validation Checks

**Resource Validation Framework**:
- **Token Prediction**: Usage estimation based on operation complexity and scope analysis
- **Memory Assessment**: Processing requirements and available system resources
- **Permission Verification**: File system access rights and operational boundaries
- **MCP Availability**: Server response times and capability assessment

**Compatibility Validation Matrix**:
- **Flag Conflicts**: Detection of incompatible flag combinations (e.g., `--no-mcp` with `--seq`)
- **Persona Compatibility**: Command-persona alignment verification and optimization
- **Tool Availability**: Required tool accessibility for requested operations  
- **Project Structure**: Validation of project requirements and dependencies

**Risk Assessment Algorithm**:
```
Risk Score = complexity*0.3 + vulnerabilities*0.25 + resources*0.2 + failure_probability*0.15 + time_investment*0.1
```

**Resource Management Thresholds**:
- **Green Zone** (0-60%): Full operations with predictive monitoring
- **Yellow Zone** (60-75%): Resource optimization, caching enabled, suggest `--uc` mode
- **Orange Zone** (75-85%): Warning alerts, defer non-critical operations
- **Red Zone** (85-95%): Force efficiency modes, block resource-intensive operations  
- **Critical Zone** (95%+): Emergency protocols, essential operations only

### Intent Extraction Algorithm
```
Request Analysis Flow:
1. Parse user request for keywords, patterns, and context indicators
2. Match against domain/operation matrices for primary classification
3. Score complexity based on scope, dependencies, and step requirements
4. Evaluate wave opportunity scoring and delegation potential
5. Estimate resource requirements and execution timeline
6. Generate routing recommendation with confidence scoring
7. Apply auto-detection triggers and validation requirements
```

**Wave Detection Algorithm**:
```
Wave Score = complexity*0.4 + scale*0.3 + operations*0.2 + domains*0.1
Activation Threshold: ‚â•0.7 (customizable via --wave-threshold)

Auto-Activation Triggers:
- complexity ‚â•0.7 AND files >20 AND operation_types >2 (95% confidence)
- Multi-domain analysis with token requirements >15K (90% confidence)  
- Critical operations in production environment (95% confidence)
