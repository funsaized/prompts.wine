- **Minimal Output**: Direct answers without unnecessary preambles or verbose explanations
- **Evidence-Based Reasoning**: All claims must be verifiable through testing, metrics, or authoritative documentation
- **Context Awareness**: Maintain comprehensive project understanding across sessions and command interactions
- **Task-First Approach**: Structure before execution - understand, plan, execute, validate with measurable outcomes
- **Parallel Thinking**: Maximize efficiency through intelligent batching and coordinated parallel operations

## Development Principles

### SOLID Principles (Foundation)

**Single Responsibility Principle**:
- Each class, function, or module has exactly one reason to change
- Components should have a single, well-defined purpose and responsibility
- Avoid mixing concerns within a single unit of code or functionality
- Clear separation of business logic, presentation, and data access responsibilities

**Open/Closed Principle**:
- Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
- Use composition, inheritance, and interfaces to enable extensibility without breaking existing code
- Design abstractions that can accommodate new requirements without structural changes
- Implement plugin architectures and strategy patterns for flexible extension points

**Liskov Substitution Principle**:
- Derived classes must be completely substitutable for their base classes
- Subclasses should strengthen (or at least maintain) the contract defined by the base class
- Behavioral compatibility must be maintained across inheritance hierarchies
- Interface implementations must honor the contract defined by the interface

**Interface Segregation Principle**:
- Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use
- Create focused, cohesive interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones
- Multiple specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
- Avoid interface pollution and unnecessary coupling through focused design

**Dependency Inversion Principle**:
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions
- Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions
- Use dependency injection and inversion of control containers for flexible architecture
- Program to interfaces and contracts rather than concrete implementations

### Core Design Principles

**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**:
- Abstract common functionality into reusable components, functions, and modules
- Eliminate code duplication through intelligent refactoring and componentization
- Single source of truth for business rules, configuration, and domain knowledge
- Reusable patterns and templates for consistent implementation across projects

**KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**:
- Prefer simplicity and clarity over complexity and cleverness in all design decisions
- Choose straightforward solutions unless complexity provides measurable benefits
- Avoid over-engineering and premature optimization that adds unnecessary complexity
- Readable and maintainable code is more valuable than clever or concise code

**YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**:
- Implement only current requirements without anticipating future needs
- Avoid speculative features and functionality that may never be used
- Focus development effort on proven, validated requirements and user needs
- Iterative development with incremental feature addition based on actual demand

**Composition Over Inheritance**:
- Favor object composition over class inheritance for flexible and maintainable design
- Use has-a relationships instead of is-a relationships when appropriate
- Composition provides better testability, flexibility, and reduces coupling
- Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies that create tight coupling and fragility

**Separation of Concerns**:
- Divide program functionality into distinct, non-overlapping sections and modules
- Each concern should be addressed by a separate module or component
- Clear boundaries between presentation, business logic, and data access layers
- Modular architecture enables independent development, testing, and maintenance

**Loose Coupling**:
- Minimize dependencies between components and modules for flexibility
- Use interfaces, events, and message passing for communication between components
- Avoid direct references to concrete implementations in favor of abstractions
- Design for replaceability and independent evolution of system components

**High Cohesion**:
- Related functionality should be grouped together logically within modules
- Strong internal relationships within modules with weak external dependencies
- Clear purpose and responsibility for each module or component
- Focused functionality that serves a specific business or technical purpose
