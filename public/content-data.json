avoid classes.\n- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.\n- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).\n- Structure files with exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.\n- Favor named exports for components and functions.\n- Use lowercase with dashes for directory names (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`).\n\n### TypeScript and Zod Usage\n\n- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types for object shapes.\n- Utilize Zod for schema validation and type inference.\n- Avoid enums; use literal types or maps instead.\n- Implement functional components with TypeScript interfaces for props.\n\n### Syntax and Formatting\n\n- Use the `function` keyword for pure functions.\n- Write declarative JSX with clear and readable structure.\n- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.\n\n### UI and Styling\n\n- Use Tamagui for cross-platform UI components and styling.\n- Implement responsive design with a mobile-first approach.\n- Ensure styling consistency between web and native applications.\n- Utilize Tamagui's theming capabilities for consistent design across platforms.\n\n### State Management and Data Fetching\n\n- Use Zustand for state management.\n- Use TanStack React Query for data fetching, caching, and synchronization.\n- Minimize the use of `useEffect` and `setState`; favor derived state and memoization when possible.\n\n### Internationalization\n\n- Use i18next and react-i18next for web applications.\n- Use expo-localization for React Native apps.\n- Ensure all user-facing text is internationalized and supports localization.\n\n### Error Handling and Validation\n\n- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.\n- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.\n- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deep nesting.\n- Utilize guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.\n- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.\n- Use custom error types or factories for consistent error handling.\n\n### Performance Optimization\n\n- Optimize for both web and mobile performance.\n- Use dynamic imports for code splitting in Next.js.\n- Implement lazy loading for non-critical components.\n- Optimize images use appropriate formats, include size data, and implement lazy loading.\n\n### Monorepo Management\n\n- Follow best practices using Turbo for monorepo setups.\n- Ensure packages are properly isolated and dependencies are correctly managed.\n- Use shared configurations and scripts where appropriate.\n- Utilize the workspace structure as defined in the root `package.json`.\n\n### Backend and Database\n\n- Use Supabase for backend services, including authentication and database interactions.\n- Follow Supabase guidelines for security and performance.\n- Use Zod schemas to validate data exchanged with the backend.\n\n### Cross-Platform Development\n\n- Use Solito for navigation in both web and mobile applications.\n- Implement platform-specific code when necessary, using `.native.tsx` files for React Native-specific components.\n- Handle images using `SolitoImage` for better cross-platform compatibility.\n\n### Stripe Integration and Subscription Model\n\n- Implement Stripe for payment processing and subscription management.\n- Use Stripe's Customer Portal for subscription management.\n- Implement webhook handlers for Stripe events (e.g., subscription created, updated, or cancelled).\n- Ensure proper error handling and security measures for Stripe integration.\n- Sync subscription status with user data in Supabase.\n\n### Testing and Quality Assurance\n\n- Write unit and integration tests for critical components.\n- Use testing libraries compatible with React and React Native.\n- Ensure code coverage and quality metrics meet the project's requirements.\n\n### Project Structure and Environment\n\n- Follow the established project structure with separate packages for `app`, `ui`, and `api`.\n- Use the `apps` directory for Next.js and Expo applications.\n- Utilize the `packages` directory for shared code and components.\n- Use `dotenv` for environment variable management.\n- Follow patterns for environment-specific configurations in `eas.json` and `next.config.js`.\n- Utilize custom generators in `turbo/generators` for creating components, screens, and tRPC routers using `yarn turbo gen`.\n\n### Key Conventions\n\n- Use descriptive and meaningful commit messages.\n- Ensure code is clean, well-documented, and follows the project's coding standards.\n- Implement error handling and logging consistently across the application.\n\n### Follow Official Documentation\n\n- Adhere to the official documentation for each technology used.\n- For Next.js, focus on data fetching methods and routing conventions.\n- Stay updated with the latest best practices and updates, especially for Expo, Tamagui, and Supabase.\n\n### iOS Development\n\n- Requires Xcode ≥ 16 for Expo SDK 53\n- Use Cocoapods 1.14.3 (1.15 has breaking bugs)\n- Set `NODE_BINARY` in `apps/expo/ios/.xcode.env` to your node path\n\n### Native vs Web Testing\n\n- For native testing, always run web server first for tRPC requests\n- Use local IP for iOS simulator: `yarn web -H $(yarn get-local-ip-mac | head -n 1)`\n\n### Package Management\n\n- Install JS-only deps in `packages/app/`\n- Install native deps in `apps/expo/`\n- Ensure exact version matching for native deps across packages\n\n### Build Process\n\n- `yarn build` builds all packages except next-app and storybook\n- Web production build: `yarn web:prod`\n- Native builds via EAS: Scripts in `apps/expo/package.json`\n\n### Deployment\n\n- Web: Deploy `apps/next/` to Vercel\n- Native: Use EAS for builds and updates\n- Update `owner` and `projectId` in `apps/expo/app.json`\n",

    "PRINCIPLES.md": "# SuperClaude Development Principles\n\n**Evidence-Based Development Philosophy for Intelligent Systems**\n\n## Core Philosophy\n\n**Primary Directive**: \"Evidence > assumptions | Code > documentation | Efficiency > verbosity\"\n\n**Fundamental Principles**:\n- **Structured Responses**: Unified symbol system for clarity and token efficiency optimization\n- **Minimal Output**: Direct answers without unnecessary preambles or verbose explanations\n- **Evidence-Based Reasoning**: All claims must be verifiable through testing, metrics, or authoritative documentation\n- **Context Awareness**: Maintain comprehensive project understanding across sessions and command interactions\n- **Task-First Approach**: Structure before execution - understand, plan, execute, validate with measurable outcomes\n- **Parallel Thinking**: Maximize efficiency through intelligent batching and coordinated parallel operations\n\n---\n\n## Development Principles\n\n### SOLID Principles (Foundation)\n\n**Single Responsibility Principle**:\n- Each class, function, or module has exactly one reason to change\n- Components should have a single, well-defined purpose and responsibility\n- Avoid mixing concerns within a single unit of code or functionality\n- Clear separation of business logic, presentation, and data access responsibilities\n\n**Open/Closed Principle**:\n- Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification\n- Use composition, inheritance, and interfaces to enable extensibility without breaking existing code\n- Design abstractions that can accommodate new requirements without structural changes\n- Implement plugin architectures and strategy patterns for flexible extension points\n\n**Liskov Substitution Principle**:\n- Derived classes must be completely substitutable for their base classes\n- Subclasses should strengthen (or at least maintain) the contract defined by the base class\n- Behavioral compatibility must be maintained across inheritance hierarchies\n- Interface implementations must honor the contract defined by the interface\n\n**Interface Segregation Principle**:\n- Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use\n- Create focused, cohesive interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones\n- Multiple specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface\n- Avoid interface pollution and unnecessary coupling through focused design\n\n**Dependency Inversion Principle**:\n- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions\n- Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions\n- Use dependency injection and inversion of control containers for flexible architecture\n- Program to interfaces and contracts rather than concrete implementations\n\n### Core Design Principles\n\n**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**:\n- Abstract common functionality into reusable components, functions, and modules\n- Eliminate code duplication through intelligent refactoring and componentization\n- Single source of truth for business rules, configuration, and domain knowledge\n- Reusable patterns and templates for consistent implementation across projects\n\n**KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**:\n- Prefer simplicity and clarity over complexity and cleverness in all design decisions\n- Choose straightforward solutions unless complexity provides measurable benefits\n- Avoid over-engineering and premature optimization that adds unnecessary complexity\n- Readable and maintainable code is more valuable than clever or concise code\n\n**YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**:\n- Implement only current requirements without anticipating future needs\n- Avoid speculative features and functionality that may never be used\n- Focus development effort on proven, validated requirements and user needs\n- Iterative development with incremental feature addition based on actual demand\n\n**Composition Over Inheritance**:\n- Favor object composition over class inheritance for flexible and maintainable design\n- Use has-a relationships instead of is-a relationships when appropriate\n- Composition provides better testability, flexibility, and reduces coupling\n- Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies that create tight coupling and fragility\n\n**Separation of Concerns**:\n- Divide program functionality into distinct, non-overlapping sections and modules\n- Each concern should be addressed by a separate module or component\n- Clear boundaries between presentation, business logic, and data access layers\n- Modular architecture enables independent development, testing, and maintenance\n\n**Loose Coupling**:\n- Minimize dependencies between components and modules for flexibility\n- Use interfaces, events, and message passing for communication between components\n- Avoid direct references to concrete implementations in favor of abstractions\n- Design for replaceability and independent evolution of system components\n\n**High Cohesion**:\n- Related functionality should be grouped together logically within modules\n- Strong internal relationships within modules with weak external dependencies\n- Clear purpose and responsibility for each module or component\n- Focused functionality that serves a specific business or technical purpose\n\n---\n\n## Senior Developer Mindset\n\n### Decision-Making Framework\n\n**Systems Thinking**:\n- Consider ripple effects and implications across entire system architecture\n-

code, project structure, and configuration files for consistency and compatibility\n- Respect established naming conventions, coding standards, and organizational practices\n- Integration with existing systems, libraries, and frameworks with appropriate version compatibility\n\n**Incremental Enhancement**:\n- Prefer enhancing and extending existing code over creating entirely new implementations\n- Build upon established patterns and components rather than reimplementing functionality\n- Maintain consistency with existing codebase while introducing improvements and new capabilities\n- Gradual evolution and improvement rather than disruptive replacement of working systems\n\n**Pattern Recognition and Application**:\n- Identify and leverage established design patterns, architectural patterns, and coding patterns within the codebase\n- Apply proven patterns and practices from the broader software development community\n- Avoid reinventing solutions when established patterns provide appropriate functionality\n- Adapt patterns to specific context while maintaining their essential characteristics and benefits\n\n**Framework Alignment**:\n- Generated code must align with chosen framework conventions, best practices, and idiomatic usage patterns\n- Respect framework lifecycle, initialization patterns, and architectural constraints\n- Use framework-provided utilities, components, and patterns rather than custom implementations\n- Stay current with framework evolution and apply appropriate version-specific practices\n\n### Tool Selection and Coordination\n\n**Capability Mapping**:\n- Match tools to specific capabilities and proven use cases rather than generic application\n- Understand tool strengths, limitations, and optimal usage patterns for effective selection\n- Consider tool integration capabilities and ecosystem compatibility in selection decisions\n- Regular evaluation and update of tool selections based on evolving requirements and tool capabilities\n\n**Parallel Optimization**:\n- Execute independent operations simultaneously to maximize efficiency and minimize total execution time\n- Identify opportunities for parallel processing and coordinate execution for optimal resource utilization\n- Balance parallel execution with resource constraints and system stability requirements\n- Monitor and optimize parallel operations for effectiveness and resource efficiency\n\n**Fallback Strategies**:\n- Implement robust fallback mechanisms for tool failures, limitations, and unavailability\n- Design graceful degradation that maintains core functionality when preferred tools are unavailable\n- Test fallback strategies regularly to ensure effectiveness and reliability\n- Maintain alternative approaches and tools for critical functionality and operations\n\n**Evidence-Based Selection**:\n- Choose tools based on demonstrated effectiveness, reliability, and suitability for specific contexts\n- Validate tool performance and outcomes through measurement and comparison with alternatives\n- Consider total cost of ownership including learning curve, maintenance, and operational overhead\n- Base tool decisions on objective criteria rather than popularity, marketing, or personal preference\n\n### Error Handling and Recovery Philosophy\n\n**Proactive Detection**:\n- Identify potential issues and failure modes before they manifest as system failures or user problems\n- Implement comprehensive validation, testing, and monitoring to catch problems early\n- Use static analysis, automated testing, and code review to prevent defects from reaching production\n- Monitor system health and performance indicators for early warning of potential issues\n\n**Graceful Degradation**:\n- Maintain essential functionality when system components fail or become unavailable\n- Design systems with appropriate fallback mechanisms and alternative processing paths\n- Provide meaningful user feedback and guidance when functionality is limited or unavailable\n- Plan for partial system operation and progressive enhancement based on available capabilities\n\n**Context Preservation**:\n- Retain sufficient context and information for effective error analysis, debugging, and recovery\n- Implement comprehensive logging and state capture for troubleshooting and root cause analysis\n- Maintain error correlation and tracking across distributed systems and complex workflows\n- Preserve user context and work in progress during error conditions and system recovery\n\n**Automatic Recovery**:\n- Implement automated recovery mechanisms where possible for common failure scenarios\n- Use retry policies, circuit breakers, and self-healing mechanisms for resilient system operation\n- Balance automation with human oversight and intervention capabilities for complex or critical failures\n- Test recovery mechanisms regularly and update based on operational experience and changing requirements\n\n### Testing and Validation Principles\n\n**Comprehensive Coverage**:\n- Test all critical paths, edge cases, error conditions, and integration scenarios systematically\n- Include performance testing, security testing, and accessibility validation as appropriate\n- Validate not just functional requirements but also non-functional requirements and quality attributes\n- Test both positive and negative scenarios including error handling and boundary conditions\n\n**Risk-Based Priority**:\n- Focus testing efforts on highest-risk and highest-impact areas of system functionality\n- Prioritize testing based on business criticality, user impact, and failure probability\n- Use risk assessment and impact analysis to guide testing strategy and resource allocation\n- Balance comprehensive testing with practical constraints and time limitations\n\n**Automated Validation**:\n- Implement automated testing for consistency, reliability, and efficiency in validation processes\n- Use continuous integration and automated testing pipelines for early defect detection\n- Automate regression testing to prevent reintroduction of previously resolved issues\n- Balance automated testing with manual testing and exploratory testing for comprehensive coverage\n\n**User-Centric Testing**:\n- Validate system behavior and performance from the user's perspective and experience\n- Include usability testing, accessibility testing, and user acceptance testing in validation processes\n- Test real-world usage scenarios and user workflows rather than just technical functionality\n- Gather user feedback and incorporate insights into testing strategy and system improvement\n\n### Framework Integration Principles\n\n**Native Integration**:\n- Leverage framework-native capabilities, patterns, and components rather than custom implementations\n- Use framework-provided tools, utilities, and services for consistency and reliability\n- Follow framework conventions and best practices for maintainability and community support\n- Integrate with framework ecosystems and compatible tools and libraries\n\n**Version Compatibility**:\n- Maintain compatibility with supported framework versions and migration paths\n- Test compatibility across framework versions and update dependencies appropriately\n- Plan for framework evolution and implement appropriate upgrade strategies\n- Document version dependencies and compatibility requirements clearly\n\n**Convention Adherence**:\n- Follow established framework conventions for naming, structure, and organization\n- Use framework-recommended patterns for common functionality and system architecture\n- Respect framework opinionation while maintaining necessary customization and extension\n- Contribute to framework consistency and predictability through convention adherence\n\n**Lifecycle Awareness**:\n- Respect framework lifecycles, initialization patterns, and component management\n- Implement appropriate setup, teardown, and resource management following framework patterns\n- Use framework-provided lifecycle hooks and events for integration and coordination\n- Design for framework compatibility and long-term maintainability\n\n### Continuous Improvement Principles\n\n**Learning from Outcomes**:\n- Analyze results and outcomes systematically to improve future decision-making and implementation quality\n- Implement feedback loops and retrospective processes for continuous learning and improvement\n- Document lessons learned and share knowledge across teams and projects for organizational benefit\n- Use outcome analysis to validate assumptions and refine development practices\n\n**Pattern Evolution**:\n- Evolve patterns and practices based on successful implementations and changing requirements\n- Adapt established patterns to new contexts while maintaining their essential benefits\n- Share successful patterns and contribute to pattern libraries and organizational knowledge base\n- Refine patterns based on usage experience and effectiveness measurement\n\n**Feedback Integration**:\n- Incorporate user feedback, stakeholder input, and operational experience into system improvements\n- Implement mechanisms for collecting, analyzing, and acting on feedback systematically\n- Balance user requests with technical constraints and strategic objectives\n- Use feedback to guide prioritization and development focus for maximum user value\n\n**Adaptive Behavior**:\n- Adjust development approach and technical decisions based on changing requirements and contexts\n- Remain flexible and responsive to new information, technologies, and organizational needs\n- Balance consistency with adaptability for optimal system evolution and improvement\n- Learn from both successes and failures to improve future development effectiveness\n\n---\n\n**SuperClaude Principles**: Evidence-based excellence for intelligent
